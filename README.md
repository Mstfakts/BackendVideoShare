# Video share platform: VideoShare
This project was done for the C++ (Programming for Engineers) course in 2019-2020 Fall.

The purpose of this project was to create the backend of a video sharing platform. Since we were done with this project in the C++ course, 
the front-end part of it did not complete.

This project mainly includes 5 parts, these are; 
*Linked List part for some connection, 
*Video class to create (upload) videos, 
*User class to create users(account), 
*VideoShare class to invoke some events between users and videos, 
*and a test class.
