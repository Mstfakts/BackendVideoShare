# Video share platform: VideoShare
This project was done for the C++ (Programming for Engineers) course in 2019-2020 Fall.

The purpose of this project was to create the backend of a video sharing platform. Since we were done with this project in the C++ course, 
the front-end part of it did not complete.

This project mainly includes 5 parts, these are; 
- Linked List part for some connection, 
- Video class to create (upload) videos, 
- User class to create users(account), 
- VideoShare class to invoke some events between users and videos, 
- and a test class.

Linked List part includes **Node.h** and **LinkedList.h**. They were coded to struct the connection part.

**Video.h** is for the videos that the users upload.

**User.h** is to create users.

**VideoShare.h** lets the user like some videos and add frineds.

**Main.cpp** is our test class.
